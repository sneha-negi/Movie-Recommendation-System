MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:
**DATASET**
[Kaggle TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
Developed a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests
movies similar to a selected movie. The system processes movie data to
generate tags, converts these tags into vectors, and calculates the cosine
similarity between these vectors to recommend the top 5 similar movies.
Additionally, I created an interactive user interface using Streamlit and
integrated movie images from the TMDb API.
